[English](README.md) | [繁體中文](README_zh-TW.md) | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md) | [日本語](README_ja.md) | [한국어](README_ko.md)

A powerful web tool designed to remove localized watermarks from images generated by Google Gemini. This tool runs entirely in your browser, ensuring your privacy by not uploading images to any server.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚫 Automatic Watermark Removal**: Uses a Reverse Alpha Blending algorithm to precisely restore pixels covered by the watermark.
- **🎨 Custom Logo Support**: Upload your own logo to replace the original watermark with adjustable opacity (0% ~ 100%) and size (10% ~ 200%).
- **🔒 Privacy First**: All processing is done locally in your browser; images never leave your device.
- **⚡ Instant Preview**: Upload and process instantly for quick results.
- **🖱️ Drag & Drop Support**: Simply drag images into the window to process them.
- **👀 Comparison Mode**: Long press (or click and hold) the processed image to see the original for comparison.
- **⚙️ Smart & Manual Modes**:
  - **Auto Detect**: Automatically determines watermark size based on image resolution.
  - **Manual Selection**: Force "Small" (48px) or "Large" (96px) mode for special cases.
- **💾 High-Quality Download**: Download processed images in PNG format with a single click.

## 🛠️ How It Works

This project is implemented using pure JavaScript (Canvas API). It pre-loads the Alpha mask of the Gemini watermark and "reverses" the watermark's effect by calculating the original color values of each pixel, achieving a lossless or near-invisible removal.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the Page**: Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
2. **Upload Images**: Click the upload area or drag JPG/PNG/WEBP images into it.
3. **View Results**: The system will automatically process and display the results.
4. **Adjust Settings** (If needed): If the result is not perfect, try switching modes in the dropdown menu ("Force Small" or "Force Large").
5. **Download**: Click the "Download" button to save your image.

## 📦 Installation & Running Locally

This is a static web project requiring no complex backend environment.

1. **Clone the Project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevintsai1202/GeminiWatermarkRemove.git
   ```
2. **Enter Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd GeminiWatermarkRemove
   ```
3. **Run**:
   Open `index.html` in your browser.
   *Note: Due to browser CORS policies, loading local mask images directly via `file://` might fail. It is recommended to run a simple local server, for example using Python:*
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
